This little piece of text is about Balloons Tower Defense specifically BTD6. BTD6 is a tower defense game where you, the player, have to build up defenses with different classes of monkeys to pop balloons. As the rounds progress the balloons get stronger and the less money you begin to make. You can pick from a variety of monkeys, with my personal favorite being the Glue Gunner. You also get access to Heros who are monkeys that will unlock new abilites as they gain levels. Pair up defenses and heros to see what the highest round you can get to is!
