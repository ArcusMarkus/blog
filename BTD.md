This little piece of text is about **Balloons Tower Defense** specifically *BTD6*. *BTD6* is a tower defense game where you, the player, have to build up defenses with different classes of monkeys to pop balloons. As the rounds progress the stronger the balloons get and the less money you begin to make. You can pick from a variety of monkeys, with my personal favorite being the **Glue Gunner Monkey**. You also get access to **Heroes** who are monkeys that will unlock new abilites as they gain levels. Pair up defenses and heroes to see what the highest round you can get to is!
