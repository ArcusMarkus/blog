When first making this blog the beginning parts like messing with repositories in the wonderful Github was simple. But that's when IT decided to invade my brain and cause irreversible damage. I have had no experience using the command line or Linux and lets just say I would rather be stuck in Itachi Uchiha's Tsukuyomi then to have to figure to endure the pain that was installing ruby, bundler, and jekyll. Installing Jekyll and bundler made absolutely no sense because Jekyll required a gem that ruby wasn't provided because giving out gems just just didn't work or something. Bundler just had issues with file permissions and sudo just acted like it was completeley useless because it genuinley did absolutely nothing for me. I am looking forard to never EVER having to install that stuff again and also to make some webpges because that parts actually fun. Your post must include at least two links and a list.
